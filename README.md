# Tails technical challenge

## Set Up

1. Create a virtualenv with Python 3 
2. Install dependencies with pip from requirements.txt
3. Run the server with python app.py
4. Run tests with python tests.py while the server is running

Implemented the find nearby store functionality and added testing with unittest and Selenium. Fixed Bagshot and Rayleigh postcode errors and replaced underscores with whitespace in store names. Used bootstrap to make the frontend less of an eyesore.
